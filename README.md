# coot-trimmings
Python customizations for the macromolecular model building software Coot.

Copy to ~/.coot-preferences (hidden dir, copy on command line) and restart coot.

You should see a new menu ("Custom") and a bunch of new key bindings, as well as a couple of new toolbar buttons (e.g. "sequence context").

Email me if you run into any trouble (olibclarke at gmail dot com).

I haven't tested most of these on WinCoot, or on older versions of Coot. Most testing done with Coot 0.8.8 or later.

Also, many of the functions here haven't been tested on molecules with insertion codes. If this is important to you, let me know and I'll fix.
