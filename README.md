# coot-trimmings
Python customizations for the macromolecular model building software Coot.

Copy to ~/.coot-preferences (hidden dir, copy on command line) and restart coot.

You should see a new menu ("Custom") and a bunch of new key bindings, as well as aa couple of new toolbar buttons (e.g. "sequence context").

Email me if you run into any trouble (olibclarke at gmail dot com).
